Saint-Exupéry was assigned to Reconnaissance Group II/33 flying the twin-engine Bloch MB.170. At the start of the war there were only fifty reconnaissance crews, of which twenty-three were in his unit. Within the first few days of the German invasion of France in May 1940, seventeen of the II/33 crews were sacrificed recklessly, he writes ""like glasses of water thrown onto a forest fire"".عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «خلبان جنگ»؛ «خلبان جنگی»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش سال 1971میلادیعنوان: خ‍ل‍ب‍ان‌ ج‍ن‍گ‌؛ ن‍ویسنده‌ آنتوان دو س‍ن‍ت‌ اگ‍زوپ‍ری‌؛ مت‍رج‍م اق‍دس‌ ی‍غ‍م‍ای‍ی‌؛ ‏‫ت‍ه‍ران‌‬‏‫: امیرکبیر، کتاب‌های جیبی‬‏‫‏‏، 1349؛ در 251ص؛ چاپ دوم 1356؛ چاپ چهارم 1392؛ شابک 9789640013946؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، نیلوفر 1382؛ در 227ص؛ شابک 9644482225؛ چاپ چهارم 1392؛ چاپ دیگر علمی فرهنگی؛ سال 1394؛ در بیست و دو و 248ص؛ شابک 9786001216381؛ موضوع داستانهای جنگ از نویسندگان فرانسه - سده 20معنوان: خلبان جنگ؛ آنتوان‌ دو سنت‌ اگزوپری؛ برگردان از پرویز شهدی؛ تهران، نشر به سخن، 1393؛ در 200ص؛ شابک 9786009412631؛ چاپ دوم 1394؛ چاپ سوم 1395؛عنوان: خلبان جنگی‏‫؛ نویسنده آنتوان‌ دو سنت‌ اگزوپری‬؛ مترجم سید‌مهدی قریشی؛ ناظر ویراستار سید‌ابراهیم آخوندی؛ ویراستار نصیر پورعلی؛ تهران، نشر پشتیبان، 1396؛ در 323ص؛ شابک 9786008794332؛کتاب «خلبان جنگ» یادمانهایی از نویسنده ی «فرانسوی» کتاب «شازده کوچولو»، «آنتوان دو سنت‌اگزوپری» است؛ ایشان این یادمانها را در سال1942میلادی بنگاشته اند، و در آنها به نقش خویش در نیروی هوایی «فرانسه»، به عنوان خلبان هواپیمای شناسایی در نبرد «فرانسه»، با «آلمان» در سال 1940میلادی، پرداخته اند؛ «آنتوان دو سنت‌اگزوپری» در این کتاب، تجربه ی ماه‌ها پرواز خویشتن را، در شرح یک مأموریت هراس‌آور، بر فراز شهر «آراس (فرانسه)» بازگو می‌کنند؛ ایشان در گروه شناسایی، با هواپیمای دوموتوره ی «پوتز 630» خدمت می‌کردند؛ «فرانسه» در آغاز جنگ دوم، تنها پنجاه خلبان شناسایی داشت، که بیست و سه تن از آنها، در گروه ایشان بودند؛ در چند روز نخست از یورش «آلمان» به «فرانسه»، در ماه مه سال 1940میلادی، هفده تن از یگان ایشان (به نوشته خودش: «همانند لیوان‌های آبی که بر آتش جنگل بریزند») جان خود را از دست دادند؛آنتوان دوسنت اگزوپری، «شاعر پرنده»، در «لیون فرانسه» در سال 1900میلادی زاده شدند، و جهان نگارش را نور باران کردند، ایشان به عنوان یک خلبان بیست و شش ساله، پیشگام هواپیمایی تبلیغاتی بودند، و در «جنگ داخلی اسپانیا»، و «جنگ جهانی دوم» پرواز داشتند؛ نوشته های ایشان «شازده کوچولو»، «باد»، «شن و ستاره ها»، «پرواز شبانه»، «پست جنوبی» و «اودیسه خلبان» هستند، ایشان در سال 1944میلادی، در حین پرواز، و در یک ماموریت شناسایی برای «گروه هواپیمایی فرانسوی» خویش، بر فراز «مدیترانه» ناپدید، و باز هم «پرنس کوچولویی» شدند و پیش همان گل یگانه ی خویش ره بگشودند ؛ روانش هماره شادتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/04/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی","really liked it"
"2","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Ian","Feb 22, 2022","I got interested in this book after it was mentioned in another book I recently read – Victoire by Roland Philipps. Up to then I had only heard of Saint-Exupéry as the author of The Little Prince.In the early stages of WW2 Saint-Exupéry was a reconnaissance pilot with the French Air Force, in an aircraft that also carried an observer and a tail gunner. Undertaking missions on their own, these planes were easy targets for enemy fighters and had a horrifying casualty rate.The fighters come down on you like lightning. Having spotted you from fifteen hundred feet above you, they take their time. They weave, they orient themselves, take careful aim. You know nothing of this. You are the mouse lying in the shadow of the bird of prey. The mouse fancies that it is alive. It goes on frisking in the wheat. But already it is the prisoner of the retina of the hawk, glued tighter to that retina than to any glue, for the hawk will never leave it now.This book is centred around a single mission in May 1940, when Saint-Exupéry was asked to fly a near-suicidal low-level sortie to photograph German Army positions around the town of Arras. By this time it was clear that French resistance to the invasion had all but collapsed. Saint-Exupéry initially regards his mission as an absurdity.We knew perfectly well that they would never be able to make use of our intelligence—luckily. It might be brought back by us; but it would never be transmitted to the Staff. The roads would be jammed. The telephone lines would be cut. The Staff would have moved in a hurry. The really important intelligence—the enemy’s position—would have been furnished by the enemy himself.Although the mission is described in detail, this is actually a deeply introspective and philosophical book, in which Saint-Exupéry considers the motivations of men in these extreme circumstances. Despite his private misgivings, he accepts his orders without demur.And now once again, like every other soldier of the Group, I have taken off in the face of every good reason, every obvious argument, every intellectual reflex.Saint-Exupéry survives this particular mission, although he was killed later in the war serving with the Free French Air Force. That fact lends even more poignancy to this account. This mission also has a profound effect on him, and after his return it crystallizes his philosophy.This is without doubt the most unusual war memoir I’ve read. I found it quite compelling, and wondered throughout what conclusions Saint-Exupéry would eventually come to. It’s very short, 156 pages in the edition I read, although I personally had to read the last 20-30 pages slowly and carefully to try and follow Saint-Exupéry’s arguments. The very last paragraph was supremely eloquent. ","really liked it"
"3","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Marc","Nov 25, 2021","I had already read some of Saint-Exupéry's earlier works and was charmed by his typical combination of action and reflection: both ‘Vol de Nuit’ (1931Night Flight) and ‘Terre des Hommes’ (1939, Wind, Sand and Stars) offer unique insights into how modern man through machines ( in this case always airplanes) is confronted with the essence of existence. Still, those two works didn't really captivate me: they got a little stuck in non-committal reflections, even if they floated on the adrenaline of a man forced to the limit in the battle with the elements. Of course, the intense experience this book, 'Pilote de Guerre' (1942, literally 'War pilote'), offers, is even more extreme. Because Saint-Exupéry here describes a hallucinatory reconnaissance mission over occupied France in May 1940. The author-pilot already knows at that moment that the war is lost for France, that his mission is pointless, and that he can only have a minimal chance to survive the low flight over the German positions around the city of Arras.Well, this time I wàs captivated by the book. Perhaps this was because the author literally takes us inside the mind of the pilot de Saint-Exupéry who is trying to come to terms with the question of why France, himself and his crew are willingly being slaughtered. And here he does it again through a combination of action scenes (steering his reluctant machine, a dizzying journey across the German barrage, a real hell-flight), of observations (of his taciturn crew, of the refugee flows, the advancing German tanks, and the land and sky seen from high altitude) and of contemplation (thoughts of killed and wounded colleagues, childhood memories, and above all musings about existence, man, sacrifice, love…).So, in itself these elements don't really diff from those in his previous novels, but Saint-Exupéry here presents it all a bit more sharply, more focused. Perhaps the intensity of this journey through hell is not alien to this. Or is it the cocktail of jest, resignation, cynicism, sarcasm and vitalism that does it? What is particularly striking is that the main character, the pilot de Saint-Exupéry, undergoes a remarkable, philosophical evolution during this death flight. Where in the beginning he still takes a rather idealistic point of view (""the real space does not exist for the eye, it is only given to the mind. And that space is worth as much as language is worth, because language connects things""), the near-death experience over Arras opens him to the view that it is the ‘substance’, the body, that makes all human experience possible (""I certainly do not want to downplay the intellect, nor the victories of consciousness. I admire clear thinkers. But what is a man without substance? A man who is a look but not a being?""). This turn is not just a fall into flat materialism, because Saint-Exupéry appears to regard man above all as a junction of relations, and thus also of the principles of solidarity, the collective and the universal, which enables him to forge a link with the sense of sacrifice. And that brings us back to the starting point: the explanation why France seems willinngly to undergo the defeat in May 1940.Certainly at the end of this novel, de Saint-Exupéry does not shy away from big words, in an emphatically pronounced confession of faith that founds humanism on a new, non-religious basis. Those final pages may seem a bit solemn, after the action scenes that preceded. Perhaps that is why he wrote the disarmingly simple ‘Le Petit Prince' (1943, The Little Prince) shortly after this novel, only to disappear in circumstances that still have not been clarified. To me this 'Flight to Arras' is his real spiritual testament.","really liked it"
"4","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Manny","May 15, 2022","In the final stages of the German invasion of France in 1940, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is sent out on a reconnaissance mission over occupied territory. It's almost certain suicide, and the information he might bring back will be of no use to anyone: the war is lost, nothing works anymore. But he accepts unhesitatingly. Somewhere over Arras, with anti-aircraft fire bracketing him on all sides, aware that he is probably a few seconds from death, he has a mystical insight. He is no longer afraid, he has done the right thing. By willingly offering his life, he is truly part of his little band of aviators, of the French military, of his country, of mankind. He knows with complete certainty that he could not have learned this lesson in any other way. Miraculously, he returns unscathed to base. He has been granted a couple more years to write this book and the much more famous Le petit prince. And he is, indeed, immortal. As long as our civilization endures, people will read him.I wonder if there are people in Mariupol right now having similar experiences.","really liked it"
"5","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Rob","Jun 20, 2010","As a kid growing up in a safe suburb of a safe country at a safe time I really did not think about things all that much.I picked up and read this book because it was about flying and WW11 both topics I was fascinated by.But this book, while I have trouble remembering the specifics, let me know that people have an inner life that is complex and compelling. That one can be brave physically and spiritually. Saint-Exupery is thinking about why the hell he is on a near suicide mission with little prospect of success or really any point at all because his country is near collapse. He does not hate Germans. He does not think France is beyond reproach. But he does know that he must continue to fight because this is a larger war than one of nations. It has a moral dimension that demands that he and his country men can not shirk.","it was amazing"
"6","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Philippe","Nov 25, 2016","Late in May 1940, Saint-Exupéry, then a 40-year old fighter pilot in the decimated French air force, flew a suicide mission in a reconnaissance plane. Against all the odds the crew returns in one piece. But in the crucible above the northern French city of Arras, something happens. Saint-Ex returns as a changed man. His despondency and scepticism about the war effort had been sublimated into a deep understanding of his position in this conflict. The final chapters of the book take the form of a manifesto in which the author clarifies this stance. The pivotal gesture is Saint-Exupéry's commitment to love. That commitment is understood as one's investment into 'a web of relationships that makes people grow'. (I am relying here on my own rendering of the author's very straightforward ""un réseau de liens qui fait devenir"", rather than Lewis Galantière's more flowery but less precise ""a web woven of strands in which we are fulfilled"". The 1986 English translation in the Harcourt edition is on the whole not recommended. The 2016 Dutch translation by Nele Ysebaert in the Van Oorschot edition is excellent). For me, this is a very rich and satisfying conception of love and one that is echoed by both ancient and contemporary traditions of wisdom. This commitment to love is not the result of a rational decision but an existential(ist) leap. Saint-Ex rails against the excessive power of rationality (""l'intelligence"") in our culture. It atrophies our 'substance', our creative potential. Rational analysis is unable to bring a future into being: ""What should we do? Perhaps this. Or something else. The future cannot be determined. But what should one be? That is the essential question, as only the spirit can fertilise the rational. The spirit renders intelligence pregnant with emergence, and only then will intelligence bring the new into being. What does a man have to do to build the very first ship? It's too hard to figure out in advance. The vessel may eventually emerge from thousands of contradictory trials. But what does that person have to be? Here I'm taking by the root the potential to bring to life something new. That person ought to be a soldier or a tradesman, whose longing for faraway lands will inspire the engineers and mobilise the workers to launch, one day, his ship."" (my own translation)Saint-Exupéry elaborates a range of evocative metaphors to summon the power of man's desire. From the cockpit of his reconnaissance plane, he witnesses how German armoured units percolate through French lines like water. They keep up the pressure against the wall of the adversary and progress only there where they meet no resistance. There are always gaps. The tanks always get through. A similar force imbues the seed of grain, or a tree. It will take time, but it always finds a way to blossom. ""Defeat ... Victory ... Words I do not know what to make of. One victory exalts, another corrupts. One defeat kills, another rouses. Life does not express itself in situations but in how you deal with them. The only victory I cannot doubt is the one that is lodged in the energy of the seed. Its victory is certain from the moment it is sowed into the black earth. But it takes time to witness the triumph of the power in the grain."" (Galantière translation, with modifications)Our civilisation has abdicated its ability to build cathedrals. Instead, we are content just renting out chairs under its lofty vaults. Humanism has led us astray. It has tried to rationalise our shared project into a set of rules, a codified set of ethical principles. But that is no surrogate for the commitment to love, for the deed, indeed the sacrifice that nourishes it and brings it into being. We do not invest ourselves anymore. We have turned into bean counters and lawyers. ""We ceased to give. Obviously, if I insist upon giving only to myself, I shall receive nothing. I shall be building nothing of which I am to form part, and therefore I shall be nothing."" (Galantière translation)This book resonated more than I expected. The narration of the suicide mission is spellbinding and not without literary merits. The concluding chapters may strike one as old-fashioned and quaint, but I personally am quite ready to buy into the author's foundational intuition that there is no higher purpose in life than to contribute, in one's own sphere of influence, to an environment where people, one's brothers and sisters, may find their purpose and flourish.

"7","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Tifnie","Nov 05, 2008","I have to admitt, I couldn't wait to finish reading this book. Although the concept of this book is interested, the author and main character lost my interested when he started trailing off.Flight to Arras is about a pilot, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, and his crew on a single reconnaissance mission durning WWII. He writes about a young soldiers thoughts about receiving a mission from his caption knowing that he and his crew will not survive and accepting this mission knowing his fate. Sounds good? Indeed it does, durning this mission he questions not only this very mission he is on, but his faith, the responsibility of man, the origin of man, and ultimately God himself. However, the author goes a little overboard with his inner-thoughts and really loses the reader. At least it did me.","liked it"

I feel bad that it took me so long to actually appreciate it in its full glory, but I guess that’s just how it is with some books. They take time to sink in. Now, since I like to think I’m actually cool because I read the same book twice in two different languages, here is what I like most from the English translation;**Disclaimer; This is not a review of the book per se but rather quotes I really liked. Not all of them require context but for some, the context is important so if they look like random passages – that is the reason behind it.**Warning; Spoilers ahead.Flight to Arras – Antoine De Saint-ExupéryChapter XII, page 60; “I have aged so much that all that was is left behind me.”Chapter XIII, page 79; “What could the men who governed us know of the war?”Chapter XV, page 88; “Life always bursts the boundaries of formulas. Defeat may prove to have been the only path to resurrection, despite its ugliness. I take it for granted that to create a tree I condemn a seed to rot.”Chapter XVI, page 89; “After all, it is we ourselves who call this a funny war. Why not? I should image that no one would deny us the right to call it that if we please, since it is we who are sacrificing ourselves, not those who think our epithet immoral. Surely I have the right to joke about my death if joking about it gives me pleasure.”Chapter XVII; Throughout the whole chapter he talks to Paula, bouncing between his internal monologue directed at her and the current happenings as they fly to Arras. The whole chapter breaks my heart every time I read it. It is both absolutely beautiful and sickeningly saddening. Masterfully crafted and I believe that this was one of the more influential things in the book that made me change my mind about my initial rating.Chapter XXIII, page 135; “The kind of truth advanced in verbal bickerings can no longer satisfy me.”Chapter XXIII, page 151; “When I took off for Arras I asked before giving. My demand was in vain. We must give before we can receive, and build before we may inhabit. By my gift of blood over Arras I created the love that I feel for my kind as the mother creates the breast by the gift of her milk. Therein resides the mystery. To create love, we must begin by sacrifice. Afterwards, love will demand further sacrifices and ensure us every victory. But it is we who must take the first step. We must be born before we can exist.”Ах, да, мојот чатал нема граници. Ова се белешките и цитатите што ми оставија впечаток од македонската верзија.

He began his career in the French Air Force in the 1920s, went on to become a mail pilot in both the Sahara and the Andes, flew reconnaissance planes back in France during the German invasion of France in 1940, he escaped the Nazis. After 27 months of writing and speaking in North America, he returned to North Africa with an American military convoy. Once there, he flew a modified P-38 with the Free French Air Force in support of operations in and around the Mediterranean (overage for flight duties at the time, he petitioned for a waiver all the way to General Eisenhower). He met his end in 1944, disappearing while piloting a recon flight in preparation for the invasion of southern France. Saint-Ex was a legendary pilot, a respected and famous writer, and a hell of a guy.Saint-Ex published 'Flight to Arras' in 1942, during his sojourn in the U.S. The novel reads like the memoir of one pilot's reconnaissance mission during the Nazi invasion of France, and it has all the action one might expect from a wartime novel. But that isn't what makes it special. What makes it special is Saint-Ex's beautiful prose (translated by Lewis Galantière) and his ruminations on duty, combat, France, fellowship, and the natures both of Man and Mankind. This is the kind of book that makes the reader feel s/he is in communion with its author, sharing his most deeply felt external and internal observations. For those of us fortunate enough to fly for a living, it's also the kind of book that makes us feel like we're right there in the cockpit with him, every detail impulse true to the intellectual and emotional cast of the professional aviator.On a related note, this particular edition reminded me why I love print media. I checked this out on an interlibrary loan through my local public library, and was astounded to find that it was a first edition. The paper, with its uneven edging, was thick and luxurious to the touch. The volume smelled like an old book. I got the sense of a treasure, waiting patiently for me for nearly eighty years. When I opened it, Saint-Ex lived again through the communion of author and reader, transcending life and death to form the timeless intellectual and emotional bond that shines as the highest aspiration of art.This isn't just a beautiful book. It's the kind of book that reminds us why we invented writing in the first place. It's a treasure.Recommended for: aviators and aviation enthusiasts, WWII enthusiasts, avid readers of all sorts.","it was amazing"

When, in the Sahara, the Arabs would surge up in the night round our campfires and warn us of a coming danger, the desert would spring to life for us and take on meaning. Those messengers had lent it distance. Music does something like this. The humble odor of an old cupboard does it when it awakens and brings memories to life. Pathos is the sense of distance.But I know that nothing which truly concerns man is calculable, weighable, measurable. True distance is not the concern of the eye; it is granted only to the spirit. Its value is the value of language, for it is language which binds things together.And now it seems to me that I begin to see what a civilization is. A civilization is a heritage of beliefs, customs, and knowledge slowly accumulated in the course of centuries, elements difficult at times to justify by logic, but justifying themselves as paths when they lead somewhere, since they open up for man his inner distance.There is cheap literature that speaks to us of the need of escape. It is true that when we travel we are in search of distance. But distance is not to be found. It melts away. And escape has never led anywhere.","liked it"

The truth is that for a defeated army the problems themselves vanish. I mean by this that a defeated army no longer has a hand in the game. What is one to do with a plane, a tank, in short a queen of spades, that is not part of any known game? You hold the card back; you hesitate; you rack your brains to find use for it—and then you fling it down on the chance that it may take a trick.”“Here too everything was frozen. My controls were frozen. My machine-guns were frozen. And when I had asked the gunner about his, the answer had come back, “Nothing doing, sir.”Into the exhaust pipe of my mask I spat icicles fine as needles. From time to time I had to crush the stopper of frost that continued to form inside the flexible rubber, lest it suffocate me. When I squeezed the tube I felt it grate in my palm.“Gunner! Oxygen all right?”“Yes, sir.”“What’s the pressure in the bottles?”“Er ... seventy. Falling, sir.””","really liked it"
"14","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Gumble's Yard - Golden Reviewer","Apr 01, 2017","Short autobiographical novel by the author of “The Little Prince”, set during (and published only 2 years after) his service as a reconnaissance pilot for the French during the 1940 German invasion which service the majority of his fellow flyers did not survive. The book’s action takes place on a single reconnaissance mission low over the occupied town of Arras to gather intelligence which due to the breakdown of the French infrastructure will and can never be used. While flying and even under heavy attack (an apparent habit that the author had of losing concentration at the controls of the plane) the narrator muses philosophically on the reason for the mission (given its seeming futility), the French war effort and then the reasons for war. After escaping what seemed certain death he is overtaken by a form of euphoria and a renewed believe in the importance of community (both of France and of the squadron). After landing meditates at some length on how France is based on a humanist development of Christianity – substituting the ideal of Man for God in areas such as equality, respect, charity, self-respect, brotherhood and most importantly sacrifice – but that the abstractness of Man meant the ideal (although to be believed in) was easily corrupted into anarchism, tyranny of the masses or the fascist state. This last section is well written and well expressed albeit it doesn’t sit so well with the first part of the novel and can seem overblown rhetoric.The value of the book is in its immediacy and also importance – forming an immediate examination of the French defeat (well before the final outcome was known) and it seems being very important in restoring respect for France both internally and externally (including swaying American public opinion – where the book was written – behind intervention in the European war).","liked it"
"15","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Lily","Oct 06, 2012","A beautiful work, as always. But this felt more personal than any of the other Saint-Exupery's works I've read, probably because it was. He remembers his experiences while being a pilot in the war (hence, the original title ""Pilote de Guerre"", which, I'll admit, I like better than the English version), and the book is filled with his thoughts and ideas, portraying the war and the people in it with perfect eloquence.I have read many books about wars, from many perspectives: WWI Latvian, WWI German, WWI Indian, WWII German, WWII English, WWII Japanese, WWII Italian, WWII French, not to mention some of the other wars. What they all had in common was the war itself - no matter which one, no matter from which perspective, war is always the same. It changes people, especially the soldiers who are in the very heat of it. No matter how beautiful are the words Saint-Exupery uses, no matter in how many pages he talks about their innate calling to defend and, if needed, die for their land, war is still the worst thing humanity has devised.Starting as his search of himself in the midst of a suicide mission, ending with a poetic essay about humanity, this book is unique and yet another same old war story. And it made me understand and like Saint-Exupery more than I did before, even while reading his biography. (I didn't finish it because I always got annoyed at how arrogant he was portrayed.)","really liked it"

While I do enjoy existentialism, here it takes a turn for the vague after a certain point, where a lot of what he says could be applied in many situations, and not exclusively his. Having the general context helps a lot, but one could probably gain much more insight from this by doing some deeper historical research. ","really liked it"

Flight to Arras is nominally about a particular flight made over enemy-held territory while Hitler's forces were in the process of overrunning France. The details of that flight are frightening, but the real power of the book lies in Saint Exupery's meditations on the tragedy and uselessness of the conflict, doomed as it is, and then on his further thoughts, beautifully expressed, on the state of mankind and what it means to him to be a part of it. I won't try to be more descriptive, because whatever I would write would only diminish what he has written.

"22","157996.Flight_to_Arras","rixx","Mar 19, 2021","Published in 1942, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry talks about his life, experience, thoughts and feelings about being a pilot in WWII, while on the defensive and with little hope of surviving. The novella follows one flight, and comments on both the flight itself (mechanically, strategically) and the war in general.It's bleak. It's about death: Preparing for death, seeing friends die, seeing people die on a scale that the human brain cannot understand. It's about failure modes: A state collapsing in on itself, a mind clinging to protocol and habit. He mixes the visceral despair with lyrical observations of a pilot zoning out: ""The density of aerial warfare? Grains of dust in a cathedral."" (Take notes, sci-fi authors!)And then, in the end, he lost me: After spending most of the book talking about the horrors and absurdity of war, he uses the elation at the completed flight to turn around into a praise of the sacrifice and principles involved. ""Humanism has neglected the essential role of sacrifice"", and all that.Some more observations:As always, it's disconcerting to read things written in the midst of a big event, particularly while the end is still uncertain. In 1942, things looked terrible for France, and I'm awed reading about it.The translation uses the word ""holocaust"" in some places, and I'm not sure how well-chosen it is, given the publication date. ""Ça sauve- rait notre mission d’être sacrifiée, une panne de laryngophone"" is translated as ""A speaking tube out of order would preserve us from the holocaust."" (and another similar case), or ""Nous nous sommes jetés dans l’incendie."" as ""[We] flung ourselves into the holocaust."". The translation is also off-by-two-chapters for some reason, but my French isn't good enough to figure out what happened there.Lastly: when he talks about the absurdity of war, the missing material, the gears that refuse to mesh, the sheer scope of astonished terror, he reminds me of Vonnegut: ""After nine months of war we had still not succeeded in persuading the industries concerned that aerial cannon and controls ought to be manufactured with regard to the climate of the upper altitudes in which they were employed."", or: ""“Your death will have no effect at all. Defeat is inescapable. But it is proper that a defeat manifest itself by dead. There must be mourning. Your part is to play the dead.” “Very good, sir.”""","liked it"

The French high command was in disarray and he felt his scouting flight was probably useless and likely to get him killed. But he went anyway. Along the way on this one flight he talks about philosophy, life, the situation in France, and with the French Air Force. A sample: ""There is a cheap literature that speak to us of the need of escape. It is true that when we travel we are in search of distance. But distance is not to be found. It melts away. And escape has never led anywhere. The moment a man finds that he must play the races, go the Arctic, or make war in order to feel himself alive, that man has begun to spin the strands that bind him to other men and to the world. But what wretched strands! A civilization that is really strong fills man to the brim, though he never stir.

I read it in Russian, and I guess there were some parts translated not so well. In any case, I liked this novel a lot! It is an honest look inside the mind and soul of the author himself, the French society, European society during WWII and the whole humanity. To me, it lacks some consistency and depth, but it is so charmingly honest!!! And here is my favourite line from this book:""When the body sinks into death, the essense of man is revealed. Man is a knot, a web, a mesh into which relationships are tied. Only those relationships matter. The body is an old crock that nobody will miss. I have never known a man to think of himself when dying. Never.""(""Когда разрушается тело, становится очевидным главное. Человек — всего лишь узел отношений.

"25","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Rhys","Mar 20, 2019","Saint-Exupéry in this book develops a theory of life that seems to be the absolute opposite of that of Ayn Rand. Yet it is not socialism or utilitarianism. It is about relationships between people, about the links between communities and the individual that pull both ways. So a man will risk his life for others, even if he doesn't know them, as Saint-Exupéry did in his dangerous flights over France in order to observe troop movements, but at the same time (and this is crucial) a hundred men will risk their own lives to (for example) rescue one trapped miner deep underground. Both elements must be present. I like this philosophy of life and it is one that was forged high in the skies while coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire. It is a philosophy born of real life, and a life close to being extinguished.","really liked it"

"27","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Nathan Southern","Apr 02, 2022","I should preface this review by indicating that I’m most familiar with - and appreciative of - Antoine de Saint-Éxupery not for The Little Prince, but for two of his aviation memoirs: Wind, Sand & Stars and Night Flight. Within a prosaic context, each memoir is rife with flight descriptions so beatific that they transcend the boundaries of prose and enter the realm of the poetic. This artist knew how to repeatedly evoke his celestial hours in a way that few others have equalled, with literary sublimity and grace. I read the English language version of Flight to Arras with these achievements in the back of my mind, as the third installment in the 1942 edition hardcover omnibus Airman’s Odyssey, which also includes Wind/Sand and Flight. Yet Arras stands a bit apart from its predecessors in form and intent. At face value, de Saint-Éxupery takes as his setting World War II Europe, and relays the details of his singular reconnaissance flight to the titular French town during the German occupation of France, in 1940, as he attempts to evade Luftwaffe fire. Yet from there, the author unexpectedly diverges into dense descriptions of the madness and chaos and death that French civilian refugees encountered when attempting to flee German bomb runs. Then he springboards into an internal monologue - a protracted philosophical dialectic where he explores the nature of man, self-identification, patriotism, the necessities of charity and self-sacrifice, and what he perceived as the historical deficits of humanism. Within that framework, he makes provocative and stimulating arguments certain to divide readers, although to his credit, his ferocious opposition to fascism never wavers. The tome held my interest much of the time, but occasionally grew a bit dry in its final third, and the early translation (by Lewis Galantière) may partially be at fault - at times it loses clarity. The text assumes a poignant dimension when one learns that the author was shot down and killed over the Mediterranean two years after the work’s publication.Arras feels like essential reading for de Saint-Éxupery completists; others who want to savor the full breadth of his gifts may wish to begin with the flawless Wind, Sand and Stars, which sidesteps many of the ideological digressions taken here and dives headfirst into an aviator’s day to day experiences.","really liked it"
"28","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Penny","Oct 07, 2019","All of Saint-Exupery’s writings are exceptional. This is indeed about one flight, a flight so dangerous that it seems to be a death sentence. But the reader knows that the pilot and his crew do not die, because the book is written in hindsight. It is filled with insights about why men are willing to “die for their country” but also with the meaning of mankind, war, courage, loyalty, dying, and death. As the author examines civilization, the “rules” of war, the capabilities of the human bodies of the pilot and crew, or the planes themselves, he drifts into his own struggles to understand the bizarre situations they are facing and comes to some conclusions to help him go forward. He writes of the army on the ground who is mired in the midst of the hordes evacuating and forced to become rescuers rather than soldiers, “They were by no means sure that they were fighting a war … They were moving towards nothing more than a peace that was a pool of putrefaction … carried downstream by the civilian flood … There is no longer an army. There are only men. … They have been changed by the force of things … And not one of them could tell you, in the midst of his sweating labor, whether he was a hero or a man who deserved to be court-martialled. … Nothing would astonish him. It is a long time since he and his kind have crossed the frontiers of astonishment.”“I had always assumed that the ordeal, when it came, would be an ordeal that concerned my flesh. My flesh alone, I assumed, would be subjected to the ordeal. It was unavoidable that in thinking of these things I should adopt the point of view of my body. Like all men, I had given it a good deal of time. I had dressed it, bathed it, fed it, quenched its thirst … I had taken it to the tailor, the surgeon, the barber. … I had said of it, ‘This is me.’ And now of a sudden my illusion vanished. What was my body to me?”Well worth reading.","it was amazing"
"29","157996.Flight_to_Arras","Andrew Ives","Dec 25, 2019","(1961 edition) I don't really know what to make of this book. On the one hand, it's a straightforward story of a reconnaissance pilot on a perilous WW2 mission over enemy-occupied territory, then onwards to Arras. This story in itself might occupy about 10 pages, spread over the 168. The rest is made up of the fears, anxieties, tensions, philosophy that goes through the (real-life) pilot's mind, before, during and after the mission. In that, there is a considerable amount of philosophising, polemics and politics about civilisation, what war means exactly, France's subjugation, refugees, his group's helping in Norway, and ultimately, mankind as a whole. Much of this book reads like a cross between Virginia Woolf and Plato, especially the penultimate chapter which contains all sorts of philosophy that I didn't quite follow nor agree with. I found the part on charity somewhat well-observed though. In hindsight, this is an intelligent, maddening, yet thought-provoking book, in parts, but not one that I can say I thoroughly enjoyed or found entirely worthwhile. It was immaculately proofread, although I found the translation more than a little suspect in places, which may have contributed to my misunderstanding of some of the finer points. 3.25/5","liked it"

It's really interesting to read some nonfiction that is so exciting, the writing is pretensious but he sort of makes a cult of down to earthness at the same time. I really enjoyed parts of this book but found the philosophising at the end tedious in the extreme - it's hard to get very excited about such vague and waffley ideas and I found myself skipping bits.I suppose maybe it's a clash of styles though Saint Exupery strikes me as a romantic and not a rationalist which is basically the opposite of my personality! Having said that that's a big part of his charm aswell.He manages to communicate the feeling of being in great danger in war very well but even though the book is very short I found there was a lot of repetition.I preferred Wind, Sand and stars which had a similar pattern - some bits that I found very tedious and some bits that were gripping and full of insight.I was tempted to give this two stars but on balance it wasn't that bad, his books are very short anyway so not that painful to get through the bad bits. I finished it a few days ago and feel it conjured up some very memorable images and will probably stay with me.","liked it"
